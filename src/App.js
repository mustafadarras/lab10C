        <h2>How I installed React On My Computer</h2>
        <p>
        First, I went to "www.nodejs.org". After going into the webiste,
        I downloaded a 64 bit version of the "Node js" to my computer.
        I then installed it on my computer, then created a folder on my 
        C drive that is called "react". 
        Next, I opened Windows powershell as administrator, then on powershell
        I changed my directory to the location of my react folder, then 
        executed the command "npm init reac-app reactjs", once the installation was downloaded
        I opened the folder "reactjs" using Visual Studio Code to start editing my website.
        then I went to my reactjs folder using the cd command and then I executed the command
        "npm start". Finally, I was able to change and design my Lab10C website.
